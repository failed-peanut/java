# Experiments with Java

### Given a string find the distinct characters in it and count it. 
```java
Input:  DISTINCT
Output: DSNC 4
```
[code](https://github.com/failedpeanut/Java/blob/main/failedpeanut/src/com/failedpeanut/DistinctCharactersWithCount.java)

---
### Given a sorted array arr of distinct integers,return the lowest index i for which arr[i] == i. Return null if there is no such index.

```java
given the array [-5, -3, 2, 3], return 2 since arr[2] == 2.
Even though arr[3] == 3, we return 2 since it's the lowest index.
```

---
### Given a list of strictly positive integers,partition the list into 3 contiguous partitions which each sum up to the same value.If not possible, return null.

```java
given the array [3, 5, 8, 0, 8]
Return the following 3 partitions:
[[3, 5],
 [8, 0],
 [8]]
Which each add up to 8.
```

---
### Given a string, find the longest palindromic contiguous substring. If there are more than one with the maximum length, return any one.

```java
The longest palindromic substring of "aabcdcb" is "bcdcb". 
The longest palindromic substring of "bananas" is "anana".
```
[code](https://github.com/failedpeanut/Java/blob/main/failedpeanut/src/com/failedpeanut/PalindromeSubString.java)

---
### Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

```java
if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. 
If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?
```
